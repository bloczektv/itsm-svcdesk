# Dockerfile - svcdesk, Python 3.13.
# Two rules from docs/API.md section 9: install every dependency at BUILD time (the grader's sandbox has
# no network once the image is built) and listen on port 8080 inside the container.
FROM python:3.13-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Dependencies first, so Docker caches this layer while the code changes.
COPY requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /app/requirements.txt

# The implementation lives under src/svcdesk/.
COPY src/ /app/src/

# The SQLite file goes to /data (a named volume in docker-compose.yml), so tickets survive a restart.
